# powerbi-sales-project
I've completed PowerBI for Beginners: Sales Data Exploration project from Coursera. 
To improve my knowledge in working with PowerBI, this project helped me to understand the types of visualizing data and understanding how to derive insights.
This project involves data exploration and visualization of sales data set.
The product-sales-profit relationship is well understood by visualizing the data.
There are three files i'm attaching representing the work i have done.
mysalesdata: consists of  time-information analysis, product analysis, customer analysis, and regional sales performance.
mypractice: visualizes the average energy by month and average cost by quarter.
mychallenge: sum of average by month and per capita by sale.
